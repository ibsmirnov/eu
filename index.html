              <p>I am a computational social scientist at the <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">University of Technology Sydney</a>, where I employ a variety of computational methods—such as Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Network Science—to explore questions fundamental to the well-being of communities. My primary focus is on <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217142">inequality and segregation</a>, with a particular interest in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804996116">gender inequality</a>, on <a href="https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-020-00245-8">combining digital traces with survey data</a>, and on <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/12/pgad385/7457939">understanding and modelling human behaviour</a>.</p>

              <p>Prior to moving to Australia, I worked as an Assistant Professor at the University of Mannheim, and before that, I led a research group at the Higher School of Economics.</p>

              <p>My research has been regularly presented at flagship conferences in my field, such as <i>IC2S2</i> and <i>ICWSM</i>; published in <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>EPJ Data Science</i>, <i>PNAS Nexus</i>, and <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>; and covered by leading national and international media including <i>ABC TV</i>, <i>MIT Technology Review</i>, <i>The Times</i>, and <i>Nature</i>.</p>

              <p>In teaching, my goal is to provide social sciences students with the computational tools necessary to effectively tackle their research interests. Simultaneously, I aim to help computational sciences students appreciate the complexities of social sciences and become inspired by its big challenges. I also strongly believe in the importance of including meta-scientific knowledge in my classes, including discussions on the nuances of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GV2RHb6dc&ab_channel=JanaLasser">publishing a paper</a>.</p>

              <p>In order to empower the next generation of computational social scientists, I twice co-organised and taught at the <a href="https://sicss.io/2022/aachen-graz/">Summer Institute in Computational Social Science</a>. Additionally, in my personal time, I am developing an open online course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@computationalsocialscience">Introduction to Computational Social Science</a>.</p>

              <p>I have also been involved in social entrepreneurship, helping to launch <a href="https://uchitel.ru/">Teach for Russia</a> <span class="ru">RU</span>, a program modelled after <a href="https://teachforall.org/">Teach for America</a>, and a mentoring program <a href="https://www.scisteps.org/">Sci.STEPS</a>.</p>

                <p class="first">While there are many studies on the friendship between students, most of them focus on students from a single educational institution, i.e. study friendship ties within one school or one university. As a result, little is known about social connections between students from different schools. In this paper, I have used digital traces to investigate interschool friendship on a scale of the whole city. I have analyzed data on 37,000 students from 590 schools and their friendship links on VK and have found that students from similar performing schools tend to become online friends. One might assume that this is a trivial consequence of the geographical segregation of schools. However, by adding data on school locations and apartment prices, I was able to show that segregation in the digital space is in fact much stronger than geographical segregation.</p>

                <p class="first">In this paper, I have built a model to predict the academic performance of students from their posts on social media. I have combined unsupervised learning of word embeddings on a large corpus of social media posts with a supervised model trained on data from a nationally representative sample of young adults. This data set contains the academic performance of students measured by a standardized test as well as information on their public activity on social media. I have used a continuous-vocabulary approach that allowed achieving high accuracy using a relatively small training data set. It also allows computing interpretable scores for millions of words that are <a href="/words">fun to explore</a>!</p>

                <p class="first">Parents’ preference for sons is a well-known phenomenon that manifests in various forms from sex-selective abortions to higher investments in sons. In this paper, we used public posts made by 635,665 users on a popular Russian social networking site, to investigate public mentions of daughters and sons on social media. We find that both men and women mention sons more often than daughters in their posts. We also find that posts featuring sons receive more “likes” on average. Our results indicate that girls are underrepresented in parents’ digital narratives about their children. Previous studies have shown female characters are underrepresented in children’s books, textbooks, movies, and on Wikipedia. Gender imbalance in public posts may send yet another message that girls are less important and interesting than boys and deserve less attention, thus presenting an invisible obstacle to gender equality.</p>
